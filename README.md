# chatbot

This is a simple chatbot, initially intended to help the user book their vacation on another system.

The frontend is made with [chat-bubble](https://github.com/dmitrizzle/chat-bubble).  I had to tweek it a little bit because in this project the conversation is all held in a JS object. But my project was designed to work with a Go backend that serves and receives JSON to and from chat-bubble.

The conversation is based on a struct named passosFerias (vacation steps in portuguese). For every step there is a boolean property which is set to true after each step is compleated.

Every message received by the backend is [sanitized](https://github.com/kennygrant/sanitize) and lowercased.

The system requires no persistent data store.  All storage is done in a map data strcuture(as implemented by Go). 

The frontend sends an identification of the user in the Headers.
